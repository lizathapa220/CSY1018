      <h1>My experience of learning web development.</h1>
      <p>Learning HTML and CSS was alot of fun and exciting for me as a student with no previous experiences. I had no idea about any thing or had an Learning HTML and CSS was a lot of fun and exciting for me as a idea of what I was doing. But, as I got help from my instructor and a friend I learned a lot. As a beginner, it was very hard for me to understand anything because it was not something that I had ever learned in my school or in my high school days. But as I practiced it became easier for me to understand and once you understand the fundamental of coding, it is kind of fun and I also think the designing and coding of my website has made me more creative too.
        I expected debugging to come with coding, but I never expected it to be so difficult. But, as  frustrating and time-consuming it was, debugging has aided me greatly in the process of learning HTML and CSS, allowing me to improve my skills even further, and I believe it will continue to be useful in the future. Because I worked so hard on this project, I learned a lot about HTML and CSS. My extensive research has also been really beneficial. Finally, learning during the assignment was both enjoyable and difficult, but it was extremely beneficial to me.</p>
      <h1>Moudle learning experience</h1>
      <p>The learning experience has been a lot of fun thanks to our module instructor, who is very nice and teaches very well, and answers any questions that any student may have and tries to solve it. So far, the learning experience has been fascinating.</p>
      <h1>Report on design used in website</h1>
      <p>May 13 2022,</p>
        As agsignment suggests, the website consists of five HTML pages:
        <p>-home.html</p>
        <p>-portfolio.html</p>
        <p>-contact.html</p>
        <p>-blog.html</p>
        <p>-sitereport.html</p>
        
        <p>Home page:
        While making home page I used light yellow color as it was what I liked and seemed suitable for my web page. The image I used in the home page is my favourite picture. For animation I used keyframes.</p>
        
        <p>Portfolio page:
        There are two columns where I have used grid-layout.</p>
        
        <p>Contact page:
        I used border to distinguish contact details. I also have used box-shadow, border-radius, hover to enhance the look of it.</p>
        
        <p>Blog:
        I used column for this. Column rule for the lines in between.</p>
        
        <p> Report:
        Heading and paragraphs are used.</p>
        
        <p>Nav bar:
        Instead of using nav tag i have used div as it was easier for me.</p>
        
        <p>Hamburger icon:
        I have used Java Script, HTML, CSS to make hamburger responsive.</p>
