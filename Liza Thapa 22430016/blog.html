It was tough for me to grasp anything at first, but with the help of my instructor and a fellow student, it became simpler, and as I progressed, it became clearer and more understandable.</p>
        <p>Throughout the project
            Despite the fact that the lectures were becoming more clear during the assignment period, I had to deal with numerous challenges, and it was not easy. I had to recollect a lot of class slides, conduct research, and practice even more.</p>
        <p>Following the assignment.
            I've done a lot of practice. As a result, I am more at ease and confident than I was previously.</p>
